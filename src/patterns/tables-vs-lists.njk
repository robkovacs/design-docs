        <li>Tables are meant to help people <strong>scan</strong> and <strong>compare</strong> two-dimensional data</li>

        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <p>Tables are meant to organize two-dimensional data, and allow users to easily scan the entries of the table across one of those dimensions.</p>
        <p>This simplified weekly timecard is a good example:</p>
