            <p class="intro">Historically at Justworks, we've used a single UI component, <strong>tabs</strong>, to fulfill several different use cases. To help people better recognize these distinct use cases, we should instead use visually-distinct components to represent them.</p>

            <h2 class="toc__heading" id="tabs">Tabs</h2>
            <p>Tabs are used to separate distinct panes of content, and only show one of them at a time.</p>
            <p>The horizontal line under a set of tabs is used to indicate that those tabs control the content below them. This means that:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li>tabs should not control the content above, to the left, or to the right of them</li>
                <li>there should not be content below the tabs, in the same container, that the tabs do not control</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Segmented controls are used to show a specific subset of a larger collection of items, that are all displayed in the same way.</p>
            <p>In other words, they function as a filter on a list of items. So it's usually a good idea to have one of the controls show the entire list.</p>

            <p>In-page navigation functions as a convenient way to scroll to different key landmarks within a page. As someone scrolls, the in-page navigation is always visible, and used to indicate to them where they are within the content.</p>
            <p>Unlike tabs, all of the content that in-page navigation is associated with is always showing on the page. Weâ€™re not showing and hiding parts of our content, just scrolling to different points within it.</p>
