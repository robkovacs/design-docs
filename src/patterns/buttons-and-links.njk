    <p>Buttons and links behave differently, because they have different purposes:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li><strong>Buttons</strong> trigger some action, such as showing content on the page that was previously hidden, playing a video, or submitting a form.</li>
        <li><strong>Links</strong> take the user to a new location, such as a new web page or new section of the current page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because of their different purposes, buttons and links behave differently in both browsers and screen readers. Some examples include:</p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li>Links have a concept of whether or not they’ve been visited, buttons don’t</li>
        <li>Links can be opened in a new tab, buttons can’t</li>
        <li>Most browsers show a link's target URL in the bottom-left corner on hover or focus; but don't do that for buttons</li>
        <li>The target of a link can be bookmarked, but not the target of a button</li>
        <li>Focused buttons can be activated (i.e. clicked on) with the <kbd>Space</kbd> key, or the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> key; focused links can only be activated with <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd></li>
        <li>Some screen readers collect all links on the page in one section of their interface, and all buttons or form controls in another</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because of their different purposes, and resulting different behaviors, elements in our experiences that are styled a certain way should consistently behave as either buttons or links.</p>
