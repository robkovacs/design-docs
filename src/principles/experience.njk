            <p class="paragraph--large">Experience principles are a set of statements for how people will experience using our product.</p>

            <p>Experience principles should:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li>provide guidelines to help us create solutions aligned with both customer needs and our aspirations</li>
                <li>define what "good" design means at Justworks and hold us accountable for alignment</li>
                <li>create common constraints to reduce arbitrary decisions and ensure a unified direction</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A well-defined set of experience principles should be:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><strong>Outcome-focused:</strong> Emphasize the desired outcomes or experiences for the customer rather than specific processes or methods</li>
                <li><strong>Actionable:</strong> Guide decision-making and be actionable in the context of design and implementation</li>
                <li><strong>Applicable:</strong> Relevant across various touchpoints and channels, ensuring consistency in the end-to-end customer experience</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Allow for flexibility and interpretation to accommodate different contexts and scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>Observable:</strong> Allow individuals and teams to assess whether they are meeting the principle's intent</li>
                <li><strong>Customer-centered:</strong> Prioritize meeting customer needs and delivering value to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Memorable:</strong> Easy for team members to recall and apply in their work</li>
                <li><strong>Concise:</strong> Use as few words as possible while conveying the intended meaning</li>
                <li><strong>Inspiring:</strong> Encourage individuals and teams to think outside the box while adhering to the core values of the principles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With those goals in mind, we came up with the following experience principles for Justworks.</p>

            <h2><span aria-label="">&#x1F331;</span> Growing with confidence</h2>
            <p>Because our customers want to get things right even if they don't know what "right" is, they need complex tasks made simple, expert guidance, and the right information at the right time.</p>

        <section>
            <h2><span aria-label="">&#x1F3AF;</span> Focusing on priorities</h2>
            <p>Because our customers' time and energy is valuable, they need the work of HR administration to feel effortless.</dd>

        <section>
            <h2><span aria-label="">&#x1F320;</span> Shining in moments that matter</h2>
            <p>Because our customers care about their employees, they need help navigating through challenges and seizing opportunities during the entire employee lifecycle.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2><span aria-label="">&#x1F91D;</span> Feeling personally connected</h2>
            <p>Because our customers are human beings, they need to feel supported with empathy in every interaction.</dd>
